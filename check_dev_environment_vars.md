## Most Likely Missing Variables (Causing Your Issue)

Based on the error, these are probably missing:

1. **`SUPABASE_URL`** - Required by payment-webhook
2. **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`** - Required by payment-webhook and auto-book-interview
3. **`CASHFREE_APP_ID_TEST`** - Required by create-payment-session
4. **`CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY_TEST`** - Required by create-payment-session

## Quick Test

Add this debug code to your `payment-webhook` function to check what's missing:

```typescript
console.log('=== ENVIRONMENT CHECK ===');
console.log('SUPABASE_URL:', Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL') ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå');
console.log('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:', Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY') ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå');
console.log('=== END CHECK ===');
```

## Expected Result After Adding Variables

Once you add the missing environment variables:
1. ‚úÖ Payment webhook will work
2. ‚úÖ Auto-book-interview will work
3. ‚úÖ Complete payment flow will work

**The most likely cause of your issue is missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in development.**
