# Deploy payment-webhook to Production

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Deploy the updated `payment-webhook` function to production and update the Cashfree webhook URL.

## ðŸ“‹ Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Deploy the Function to Production

1. **Go to Supabase Production Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq/functions
   ```

2. **Create New Function:**
   - Click "Create a new function"
   - Name it: `payment-webhook` (with hyphen, not underscore)

3. **Copy the Updated Code:**
   - Copy the entire content from `supabase/functions/payment-webhook/index.ts`
   - Paste it into the new function editor

4. **Deploy the Function:**
   - Click "Deploy" to save and activate the function

### Step 2: Update Cashfree Webhook URL

1. **Go to Cashfree Dashboard:**
   - **Production:** https://merchant.cashfree.com/merchant/pg/webhooks
   - **Test:** https://sandbox.cashfree.com/merchant/pg/webhooks

2. **Update Webhook URL:**
   - **Old URL:** `https://jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq.supabase.co/functions/v1/payment_webhook_v1`
   - **New URL:** `https://jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq.supabase.co/functions/v1/payment-webhook`

3. **Verify Settings:**
   - âœ… Webhook URL: `https://jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq.supabase.co/functions/v1/payment-webhook`
   - âœ… Events: `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK`, `PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK`
   - âœ… Status: Active

### Step 3: Test the New Webhook

1. **Make a Test Payment:**
   - Use a test card or complete a small payment
   - Verify the webhook is called successfully

2. **Check Logs:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ `payment-webhook`
   - Check the logs to ensure it's processing correctly

3. **Verify Auto-Booking:**
   - Confirm that `auto-book-interview` is triggered
   - Check that the interview gets scheduled

## ðŸ”§ Key Features in the New payment-webhook

The new `payment-webhook` function includes:

### âœ… Authentication Headers
```typescript
const autoBookResponse = await supabase.functions.invoke('auto-book-interview', {
  body: { payment_session_id: sessionId, user_id: paymentSession.user_id },
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${supabaseServiceKey}`,
    'apikey': supabaseServiceKey
  }
});
```

### âœ… Better Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Proper error responses
- Graceful failure handling

### âœ… Add-ons Support
- Processes add-ons data from payment sessions
- Passes add-ons information to auto-booking

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### 1. **Keep Old Function Temporarily**
- Don't delete `payment_webhook_v1` immediately
- Keep it as backup until you confirm the new one works

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in production:
- `SUPABASE_URL=https://jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq.supabase.co`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key`

### 3. **Dependencies**
The new `payment-webhook` calls `auto-book-interview`, so make sure:
- `auto-book-interview` function is also updated in production
- All authentication headers are properly configured

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

### âœ… Successful Payment
- [ ] Payment completes successfully
- [ ] Webhook receives payment data
- [ ] Auto-booking is triggered
- [ ] Interview gets scheduled

### âœ… Failed Payment
- [ ] Failed payment is handled correctly
- [ ] Payment session is marked as failed
- [ ] No auto-booking is attempted

### âœ… Duplicate Payments

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Revert Cashfree Webhook URL:**
   - Change back to: `https://jhhoeodofsbgfxndhotq.supabase.co/functions/v1/payment_webhook_v1`

2. **Keep Both Functions:**
   - `payment_webhook_v1` (old, working)
   - `payment-webhook` (new, being tested)

3. **Debug Issues:**
   - Check function logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test authentication

## ðŸ“Š Expected Benefits

- âœ… **Better Reliability:** Proper authentication prevents 401 errors
- âœ… **Faster Processing:** Optimized webhook handling
- âœ… **Add-ons Support:** Complete add-ons integration
- âœ… **Better Logging:** Enhanced debugging capabilities
- âœ… **Future-Proof:** Latest codebase with all improvements
